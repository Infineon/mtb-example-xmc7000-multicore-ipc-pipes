</details>

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example will clone the "[mtb-example-xmc7000-multicore-ipc-pipes](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-xmc7000-multicore-ipc-pipes)" application with the desired name "MulticoreIpcPipes" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-xmc7000-multicore-ipc-pipes --user-app-name MulticoreIpcPipes --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```
The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that user LED is blinking. 


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

In this code example, CM0+ CPU is the primary CPU, which is responsible for initializing the system.

**Figure 1. CPU Synchronization using IPC**

![](images/figure-1.png)

- CM7_0 core initializes the peripheral cybsp_init().
- After CM7_0 completing peripheral initialization, force release the lock state through Cy_IPC_Drv_LockRelease function, and then wait until the CM0+ IPC server is started. 
- CM7_0 generates a notify interrupt to CM0+.
- Then, a notify interrupt occurs in CM0+.
- CM0+ starts the operation of LED ON/OFF after returning from the interrupt routine.

### Folder structure

This application has a different folder structure because it contains the firmware for CM7_0/CM7_1 and CM0+ applications as follows:
```
    |-- proj_cm0p/           # CM0+ application folder
        |-- main.c
        |-- Makefile
        |-- deps/            # All dependencies for CM0+
    |-- proj_cm7_0/          # CM7_0 application folder
        |-- main.c
        |-- Makefile
        |-- deps/            # All dependencies for CM7_0
    |-- proj_cm7_1/          # CM7_1 application folder
        |-- main.c
        |-- Makefile
        |-- deps/            # All dependencies for CM7_1
    |-- common.mk
    |-- common_app.mk
    |-- Makefile

```
