# XMC7000 MCU: Multi-core IPC pipes

This example demonstrates how to use the inter-processor communication (IPC) driver to implement a message pipe in XMC7000 MCU, message passing between CM0+ and CM7_0 using IPC pipe. Pipe0 is created between CM0+ and CM7_0.

## Software setup

See the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package installation guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxInstallguide) for information about installing and configuring the tools package.

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).


## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*)

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target)

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**

      > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box

      > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[XMC7000 MCU: Multi-core IPC pipes](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-xmc7000-multicore-ipc-pipes)" application with the desired name "Multi-core_IPC_pipes" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-xmc7000-multicore-ipc-pipes --user-app-name Multi-core_IPC_pipes --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

<br>

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

</details>



### Open the project

After the project has been created, you can open it in your preferred development environment.


<details><summary><b>Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

If you opened the Project Creator tool from the included Eclipse IDE, the project will open in Eclipse automatically.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Visual Studio (VS) Code</b></summary>

Launch VS Code manually, and then open the generated *{project-name}.code-workspace* file located in the project directory.

For more details, see the [Visual Studio Code for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBVSCodeUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_vscode_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Arm&reg; Keil&reg; µVision&reg;</b></summary>

Double-click the generated *{project-name}.cprj* file to launch the Keil&reg; µVision&reg; IDE.

For more details, see the [Arm&reg; Keil&reg; µVision&reg; for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBuVisionUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_uvision_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>IAR Embedded Workbench</b></summary>

Open IAR Embedded Workbench manually, and create a new project. Then select the generated *{project-name}.ipcf* file located in the project directory.

For more details, see the [IAR Embedded Workbench for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBIARUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mt_iar_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


<details><summary><b>Command line</b></summary>

If you prefer to use the CLI, open the appropriate terminal, and navigate to the project directory. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program; on Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application. From there, you can run various `make` commands.

For more details, see the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>


## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector

2. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE

   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that LED1/LED2/LED3 are blinking


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

```
|-- proj_cm0p/          # CM0+ application folder
   |-- main.c
   |-- Makefile
   |-- deps/            # All dependencies for CM0+
|-- proj_cm7_0/         # CM7_0 application folder
   |-- main.c
   |-- Makefile
   |-- deps/            # All dependencies for CM7_0
|-- proj_cm7_1/         # CM7_1 application folder
   |-- main.c
   |-- Makefile
   |-- deps/            # All dependencies for CM7_1
